# Eratosthenes Sieve

This Python program implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified objective number.

## Usage

To use the program, simply call the `eratosthenes_sieve` function and provide the objective number as an argument. The function will print the prime numbers found.

```python
eratosthenes_sieve(objective_number)
```

Make sure to replace `objective_number` with the actual number you want to use as the objective.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```python
eratosthenes_sieve(100)
```

This will find and print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
